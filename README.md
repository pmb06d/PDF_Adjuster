# PDF Adjuster
Good (free) PDF editors are hard to come by and some have strange paywalls for some features that make it impossible to get simple tasks done. This is a simple wrapper for PyPDF2 that reads a file and adjusts it based on a list of indexes from the user

# Features
 * GUI to select the path for the file
 * Actual page indexes (base 1) instead of python list indexes (base 0)
